Installation instructions:

Please copy all the phpbiff project files to your PHP5-enabled web server.

As this project uses the Zend Framework, you will need to ensure that the symbolic link
library/Zend points to the right location for the server's Zend Framework installation.
Currently, this link points to /usr/share/php5/Zend

If the Zend Framework is not installed on your web server (or you intend to use a Windows web
server), you will need to install a copy of the Zend Framework.
You will only need the 'minimal' version, such as that available through the following link:
http://framework.zend.com/releases/ZendFramework-1.10.7/ZendFramework-1.10.7-minimal.zip

Once you have obtained a copy of the Zend Framework, unpack it, and recursively copy the
library/Zend directory inside the library/ directory of your installation.

Next, set up a new virtual host for your installation of phpbiff.
Here's an Apache example configuration:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName phpbiff.local
    DocumentRoot /path/to/phpbiff/public
 
    <Directory /path/to/phpbiff/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
